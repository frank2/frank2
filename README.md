## Hello!

I am a malware analyst who likes to go both backwards (reverse engineering) and forwards (malware development) in my ongoing study of everything malware!
I write puzzles and packers and all sorts of fun malware tools. Documentation for various projects can be found [here](https://frank2.github.io).

Some notable projects:

* **[exe-rs](https://github.com/frank2/exe-rs)**: A PE analysis library written in Rust.
* **[goldberg](https://github.com/frank2/goldberg)**: A Rust obfuscation library showing the absolute power of the Rust macro library!
* **[packer-tutorial](https://github.com/frank2/packer-tutorial)**: A tutorial on how to write a Windows packer in C/C++.
* **[crackmes](https://github.com/frank2/crackmes)**: Various reverse engineering puzzles I've written!
* **[blenny](https://github.com/frank2/blenny)**: A functional payload delivery system which hides the malicious payload inside the icon of the executable!
* **[inflate](https://github.com/frank2/inflate)**: A simple library for bypassing entropy checks.
